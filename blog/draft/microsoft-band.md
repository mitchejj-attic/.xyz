Whats going on!?! I started using Bing search, moved from DropBox to OneDrive, from Evernote to OneNote, and now Apple is shipping the Apple watch and I buy a Microsoft Band!

I just care about the fitness/health aspect of a 'band' like product. I have zero interest in my calander, reading text message. I've been interested in the personal fitness hardware trackers for awhile now. I still remember when I first heard about the orginal FitBit and I was excited when I was finally able to order one and I used regiously for 6-8 months before it died. Eariler in the year I tried a Jawbone UP, a product very much like the orginal FitBit. Unlike FitBit the Jawbone UP product line works wiht Apples Health kit, something really appeling to me. However, it just don't live up to my expectations mostly since didn't like the iOS app. Also, couple that with the app consuming a large portion of the battery and activity with out my phone near by would never get 'counted'. What was the point of that?!?

I first went to a local Microsoft store to check out the hardware, it did seem well built albeit a bit clunky. Recent software (eco system) updates added some interesting new features which allured me even more. Out of the box I found the paring of my Phone to the Band a bit different than what I was expecting. What I was expection I would pair the band inside the the Band.app. Instead I had to first pair the band with my phone in system setting then again inside the band app; and in hindsight the pairing does make sense for notification intergration. After the pairing was complete the Band pulled down the latest firmware upgrade unlike my Echo watch it just worked.
