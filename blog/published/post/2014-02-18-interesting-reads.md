I admit it, I really don't feel that productive today so... some oddly interesting "news" stories.

[There Are Whales Alive Today Who Were Born Before Moby Dick Was Written][whales] some whales where born **before** the Civil War, **before** Abraham Lincoln became President of the United States, some where born when Lincoln was 5 years old.

[Italian and French jets escorted hijacked plane because Swiss AF was outside working hours][jets] moral of the story "If you plan to attack Switzerland, opt for non-working hours."

[New Research Reveals How Polar Bears Stay Warm][bears] its been a *cold* winter, which helps make this story intersting. But it apparently polar bears are invisible to night-vision goggles.
