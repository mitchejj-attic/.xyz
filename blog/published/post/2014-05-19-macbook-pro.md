While my trusty MacBook (4,2) has been my workhorse for sometime, and while it do undergo some life saving surgery last year it really is starting to show its age. I hoped my Mac Mini would  help push back the need yet another year. But it hasn't and while the idea of building my own system seems alluring I know I will be left wanting a portable system. I know I should wait to WWDC until I replace the system but...

Of all the 'other' laptops I've seen they have one problem I can't get around, no not the cheap build feel... but the track pad is not centered. So I was left looking between the MacBook Air and Pro. In the end I went with what will have the longest use life, the Pro and bumped out the specs. I know I love having millions of tabs open in my browser so I need plenty of RAM, since the HD is upgradeable I should go with something a tad on the larger side and since I'm buying to use the system for years I should also go with and i7. I might not need all of these 'extra' bits today but I will 2-3 years from now.

But that leads to another question. Should I install Arch or stick with OS X... or dual boot. For now I think I will move back to OS X as my main system. And keep Arch on the the MacBooks and Mini. In the realm exploration of I was thinking of using chef to try and make the system setup bit automated. Do I really want to visit 10-15 sites download, then drag-n-drop? Not really.

For the setup automation I eventually choose to use a Mac OS X front end to chef called [Kitchenplan][kitchenPlan]. While it does seem like a fantastic way to get started. However, for me it is overkill for sure, but I think I would use something similar again.

The biggest problem with my new MacBook Pro? I can't stand the current layout/design of the site. It is far beyond hideous, so I once again have an excuse to started tinker. Honestly it what I enjoy most about the site, so maybe its a bonus.
