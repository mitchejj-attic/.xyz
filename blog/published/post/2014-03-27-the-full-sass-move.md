When I chose to think about moving away from Bootstrap I need to find few plumbing/framework replacements. I like [Bourbon][bourbon] along with [Neat][neat]. I always wanted some 'help' on the typeset side of things, and [typeplate][typeplate] looks to be a nice choice, as did [Bitters][bitters]. I used all four.

Then I realized, just as I relied on Bootstrap, I was relying on these foundations. I decided I need to move away from the the support these frameworks provide in order to do my own thing. As I was finally feeling good about the direction I found [Poole][poole] along with the Hyde theme... which was professionally polished version of my vision.

I may once again jump ships, I may circle back and uses parts of various foundations but for now, I will continue work on my sub-professional looking design and enjoy what I produced.
