Talk about a late posting. I had this done for months just waiting to publish.

I slacked off all year and failed to up-date my 2015 year in running. In late 2014 to early 2015 I decided I wanted to run the Dopey Challenge along with the inaugural Dark Side Half Marathon at Disney World. I tried to make my 2015 supportive of these goals. I registered to run my home town half marathon early in the year along with the fall full marathon in Grand Rapids. I was looking forward to the full marathon in the fall, it was kind of a college homecoming.

However work had other plans for my year. I changed job locations mid summer, which wrecked havoc on my training schedule as I spend much more time than I would have liked at work. A few months later was my two week vacation to Hawaii, this trip in retrospect provided the best running memories in 2015 as I ran on for of the islands.

A few months later I changed locations yet again, and again. Once again the drive was longer, I spent even more time at work. My training wasn't where I wanted or needed it to be, so I choose to defer the Grand Rapids marathon to the following year.

2016 arrived sooner than I had expected. I felt good for the 5k and the 10k, I felt okay-ish but not great for the half marathon and knew the full marathon would be a struggle. I was a struggle, I really never felt great after the 10k --- I contribute most of the struggles to never really feeling warm for the rainy 10k.

Again, work prevented me from really putting in the training time but I felt I should be able to run my home time have marathon again and use that to gage how I should fair a month later running the Dark Side Half. Oh boy was it a suffer fest, both races.

Early summer, just before memorial day I went out on a short run and I heard and felt a pop in my lower leg... my running year just died. Noting to serious, I didn't see a doctor but I knew I just needed to rest.
