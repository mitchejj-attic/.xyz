Spring is in the air and I've been feeling the need to give the site a bit more personality. Currently I'm working on matching a few fonts together that should help shape the look and feel.

For this I choose to look at the Google Web Fonts (maybe I should look at Font Squirrel next), it seemed to provide the best way to get ensure my choices would be available to all visitors of the site. Right now I'm enamored with four unique fonts Arvo, Kameron, Overlock and Sintony. The mix of these four does seem a bit disjointed right now. I wonder what will make the cut.
