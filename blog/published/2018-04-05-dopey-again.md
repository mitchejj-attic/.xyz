The week was cold, the week was also a week of forgetting and loosing items.

What did I loose? Well ,I lost an AirPod on Flight of Passage, my MagicBand in my room after I packed away all my luggage. The AirPod was the good working AirPod, but I replaced the it when I returned home and was able to get the lesser volume AirPod replaced for free. I suppose it was a net upgrade bonus. I also found my MagicBand a few days later shoved in the toe of my running shoes.

What did I forget? I left my laptop charger at home, I forgot to eat breakfast before the half marathon, and forgot to bring my phone with me to the full marathon.

Expo
Flying into MCO was a bit interesting. The flight was very bumpy after crossing into Florida. The landing was very rough, a fellow passenger behind was throwing up the last 10 minutes of the flight and the guy next to me was headily praying. I arrived in Orlando early so my room wasn’t going to be ready. The plan was to take MagicExpress and hop off at the first resort stop then take the bus over to the WWOS of the Expo. Of course this would be the trip where my POFQ was the first stop. I nonetheless stuck the plan. I knew going into the weekend it was going to be cold. I also knew Wednesday was going to be a very wet day. Just before leaving I decided to bring my raincoat like outer shell with my. I’m glad I did as it was very using for the expo, as it was just a downpour. For me bib pick up was fairly easy, and just waited outside for about 10-15 minutes and didn’t have to wait at my pick-up station and my name was on the very first page of the book. I still had time before my room would be ready so I took a walk around the main expo floor, a very short walk before getting in line for the official runDisney merch store. That wait was just a mess, we waited good hour before being let, thankfully I was able to get a spot in line under a covered area.

5K
 
The weather; lets just talk about the 5k which was 32 with a feel like of 28. It definitely was not an enjoyable experience waiting around.

Now for the races; I actually felt really good all weekend long. I never really felt down and out. Sure I had some struggles, but over all I feel as if everything went better than I could have hoped for. My 5k and 10k times where okay and really never felt as if I was pushing myself and when I did feel like I might try to push I stopped for a short walk break to recollect my thoughts and let that adrenalin dilute itself. My half pace was a bit on the faster side of my desired pace and felt as if I might have potential harm the following race. However, I didn't do anything stupid for the full. I did my best to ensure I used 30 second walk breaks early on and found a nice pace. My only issues popped up around mile 18/19 where once again my left foot started to act up, I backed off and started to walk, and walk. This was as bad catch 22. My foot did feel better, but then when I tried to run I found it difficult to get my legs to turn over. Just before entering the stadium before mile 20 I kept reminding myself its two 5k's away and 5k's are easy just push thru it. Going into the weekend my 'A' goal for the marathon was to finish in 4:45-4:50; while my ideal happy race goal pace would have been around 11:30/mile to 11:55/mile.

I tried but eventually the pain in my foot and the toes feeling numb I thought this might not be the best idea. So mostly walked then ran a bit.
