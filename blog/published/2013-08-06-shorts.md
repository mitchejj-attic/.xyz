For a while now I've been trying to find a good method to tie my running shorts. I want to tie them so they are snug allowing me to mule around my Simple Hydration water bottle yet easy enough to untie. I found the useful posting on the LiveStrong website on [how to tie basketball shorts][liveStrong], I figured the concept is similar enough to crossover.

Also, typically I'm not a fan of sites like eHow but this time they actually have something useful, ["How to Loop a String Through Gym Shorts"][eHow].

__Note:__ First the title link really has nothing to do with the purpose of this posting. The link, was both interesting and topical.
