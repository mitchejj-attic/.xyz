When I bought my Raspberry Pi I was all gung-ho over all the little things I could do with my $35 dollar toy. I was positive my two Arch laptops would be put out to pasture. Little did I know a month later my views have changed. Mind you I can still do everything I have in mind but the more I tinkered with Arch Linux ARM the more I realized I wanted the real thing again. Knowing what I know today, I am confident I wouldn't buy the Raspberry Pi 2, instead I would look into the [Intel Edison][ie].
