**I placed this under my "sketch pad" for a reason. I doubt I will actually create the build system I have in mind.**

Ever since I picked up my RaspberryPi early 2015 I've been toying around with the idea of patching together tool to replace Middleman build/generate this site. As I think about this little project the ambitions of the project grow I need to create a roadmap to help stay focused.

The first set of requirement are fairly simple for such a build tool/system.

* ES6 (promises over callbacks) might [co][co] be useful?
* Data/content portability with Jeykll & Middleman
* Use a task/build tool
   * broccoli
      *  --- to build the  html & css
   * gulp
      * --- manage the deploy
      * --- git commits/taging
   * fly --- seems interesting but is it useful?
* CSS --- move away from SASS
   * [Best CSS Tools for 2015](https://codegeekz.com/best-css-tools-for-2015/)
      * --- uncss, cssnano, cssnext, postcss, myth.io
   * [minification-benchmark](https://goalsmashers.github.io/css-minification-benchmark/)
   * [TypeÂ­set.js](https://blot.im/typeset/)?
* Templates
   * nunjucks
      * [A Deep Dive into Asynchronous Templating](http://jlongster.com/A-Deep-Dive-into-Asynchronous-Templating)

So while the goals seem simple, something like what I want already exist in a few forms. The best way for me to move forward is to either use one of these "stock" tools or create smaller gulp/broccoli task to kick start the process.
