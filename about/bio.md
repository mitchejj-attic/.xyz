I like to think I adopt technology early, I started driving a hybrid car ealry into the second generation of Prius I also had an orginal iPhone. Growing up I loved gadgets and tinkering with widgets; When it came time for college the natural choice was computer science.  

I work 40-50 hours a week, most of the time on my feet moving around. I’ve come to enjoy running, Disney (the parks) and yes computers.

I'm now 40-something who doesn't totally get they usefulness of many nifty new tech advances, outside of a tech demos. Don't get me wrong I love computer science and everything I learned. During my senior year my drive started to fizzle out as what has best been described as an RSI problems started to heat up. Ultimately as my career path diverged my interested evolved. 

Looking back I’ve come to realize my daily personal computing needs are no longer best served with a laptop. I challenged myself to attempt to use an iPad as my main personal computing device in 2019.
