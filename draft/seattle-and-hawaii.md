THis years summer vacation is posied to be an adventure spanning nearly two weeks starting with a short two day stop in Seattle before heading to the Hawainian islands for a cruse.

Seattle
Day one, walking, not that its a bad thing. THe walk from the airport to the light rail long. Carriying dads carry on. Then the trip from the light rail station to the hotel not the best. From the hotel went looking for food on route to Pikes Market. Eventrually stopped at Cherry Street. Good Moz and tomatoe wrap. Walked around Pikes Market before deceiding on doing a tour... did the ducks. Very corney but some good knowledge, really enjoyed the time Union Lake. After the ducks back towards the hotel to look for dinner. Eventually stopped at Raccos. Okay cears salad but the asiaog crisp man up for the rest. Afterwards walked towards the Space Needle in hopes to go up around sunset. THe genearal admision was sold out and deceided to return tomorow night. (21,117 steps)

Day two
Started with a nice walk to for the Seattle Undertand tour. Unique and interesring. The plan was then to head to the fairse wheel for a ride. THe weather didn't couperate for the such a ride. Walked around more but basically headed back to the hotel to rest some before meeting back up at the Seattle Center, only to walk around to find a place for dinner before going up the space needle. Seattled on the sports bar... then walked back to the hotel for a pineapple cupcake then out to find something for breakfast for tomoorws flight then finally to walk back to the KMOD (??) Center and the sports bar. THe grilled chicken salad was one of the best one I had in years. Up the needle and back to the hotel.

We had a 530am town car for the airport. However, before leaving Sister and I walked back down th the Space Needle.. after all the flight to Hawaii is long trip. We also stopped at 7-11 for her morning Coffee. Long TSA lines at the airport. Finally arrive. Walked out to see the beach, back to a resturant at the hotel (intilian) and had the Arugura salad. Smaller portions bot th best arugula salad but fair. Everyone went beaching except me and make a walk around the main strip to see the sights. Before finding the family again for the hotel/cruise check in (3pm) and finally got room keys around 330pm... ond to find a mixup in the room... just one bed. Headed out
