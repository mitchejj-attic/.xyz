Who know some many different bed sizes existed... and how they varry based on region or country.

Anyway, for about the last 4-5 months I've been thinking I need a new mattress. I know I started keeping track of how old it is but I must have bought the thing over 10 years ago, and I can tell. However, I hated the experience of buying a new bed so I've keep putting it off.

Now I'm back at it and I'm really thinking of going the [Tuft & Needle][tn] route. But now I'm stuck is 5-inches enough? After I've always thought most of the size of a mattress is due to springs in a traditional matress. While the thickness of the foam mattress is just a play on the bigger is better mentality. But 5-inches just seems well... small.
