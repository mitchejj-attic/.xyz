This is the source repo for the main building block for everthing under my *.xyz domains. I belive I the main generator for the sites will be gatsby in a blog like configuration. Since gatsby 1.0 is still in alpha development I think it would be wised have some ability track the development merge the changes `gatsby-starter-blog` into each site.

    git clone https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog.git --branch 1.0 --single-branch xyz`

    git checkout master
        <make chnages>
    git checkout staticflux
    git merge master
    ...
    git checkout staticdraft
    git merge master
    ...
