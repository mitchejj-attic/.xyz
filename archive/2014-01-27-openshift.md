At the end of last year I purchased a new domain name and plan on migrating the site over to domain... along with completing my design changed goals. Which caused me to yet again I'm looking at other ways to host my little playground. This time around I'm looking at [OpenShift][openshift], which might be an ideal long term solution. However it does have a few catches one of which is actually a bonus, OpenShift does seem to be more powerful than most of the other "Service Platforms"... however when running something litle this playground that power can become an obstacle. Case currently OpenShift just supports ruby 1.8 and 1.9 out of the box... since I don't require "stability" I can afford to run a bit more cutting edge so I prefer to run the latest version of Ruby... as such one needs to make their own "cartridges" so far I've only found one [bootstrapping cartridge for ruby-2.x][openshiftRuby].

I doubt I will make the move but, I'm sure I will play around with it.
