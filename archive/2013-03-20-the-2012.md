I started writing this post on the plane home after completing my first marathon in January. Then it sat in my draft folder, and sat some more; the time has come to finally publish.

In 2012 I ran the Chicago Rock 'n' Roll Half along with the Walt Disney World Wine and Dine. The Chicago Rock 'n Roll went far better than I could have expected, while the Wine & Dine went far worse than I could have imagined.
