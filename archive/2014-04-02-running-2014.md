One 1/3 of the year is gone. While the year started bang, since then I haven't been running much. My desire to road has been dampened by the 'harsh' 2013-14 winter weather.

Yet, I'm still looking ahead at what my 2014 running goals might consist off. For the last two years I've been consumed with the Goofy and Dopey challenges. I love the runDisney events, I love getting away to warmer weather... but I need a slight break from the runDisney events. I know I will be kicking myself in late October for passing on the Wine & Dine again this year. I will feel like the perfect chance of complete the Cost-to-Cost Challenge slipped away when the first Avengers Half marathon nears. I'm nearly certainly want to be in Florida running when Marathon Weekend rolls around in January.

I wanted this year to be a local year, and start out with the [Fifth Third River Bank Run][5/3]. The race is the largest 25k race in the country, the event even has a [5k/25k combo][5/3combo]. I seem to enjoy doing these challenges, so maybe... but what about the fall? I could stay hyper-local and run the [Brooksie][brooksie]. I didn't get excited with either of those races.

Then I learned about the [Ground Hog Marathon & Half Marathon][hog], and reading the FAQ the event seemed intriguing... but that is definitely not a race I would like to try anytime soon. However, I found out the race director also puts on the [Grand Rapids Marathon][grandRapids] and I just love Grand Rapids. While I don't want to put in the time and effort to run another full marathon I also have a deep desire to run another full. So in the back of my mind I've been targeting this race.

I still needed to do something in the spring. One late night I ventured online and purchased a bed, then I entered the uber-local [Let's Move Festival of Races][letsMove]. It is so local I can walk to the start line.

Then today, I found out [Cedar Point][cp] has an inaugural half marathon coming up, and since [Kings Island][ki] is also a "local" park (and worth a visit) and they are the same company I wondered if they have a race as well... and they do. One is in the spring the other is the fall. Maybe this will be a nice runDisney replacement?

I have to May 15th decide upon the Grand Rapids Marathon.
