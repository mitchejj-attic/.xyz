Last year I had many plans 2014, running wise. After the Dopey Challenge I didn't do much and only finished one other event. For that event, [Let's Move Festival of Races][lets], I didn't do any training. I also entered [Kona Running Company's][krc] [Kona Run][kr], a massive fail. A few days earlier I had eye lid surgery, I miss-calculated the drive time and missed the start of the race partly due to to the eye lid surgery. Then towards the end of the year I tried complete the monthly strava Half-marathon challenge --- to have at least one 13.1 or greater run. Once the weather turned cold the days grew shorter I found it difficult to find time run let alone squeeze in 13.1 mile run.

It will be hard for 2015 to top 2014. I loved my Dopey Challenge experience, despite being up early wake up times on vacation; I also had my best half and full marathon times in 2014.

So now on to 2015 I plan on once again running the Let's Move Festival of Races half marathon. I also entered the [Grand Rapids Marathon][grm]. I would like to find one more race to complete sometime in the year. I'm thinking maybe the [Crim 10-miler][crim] or [The Brooksie Way][brooksie], however I think I will opt to do the [Run 2 Read][r2r] 10k. Finally, I also have one other date circled on my calendar... [April 28][april].
