My 2013 goal was to complete the Goofy, and I meet my goal. I was nearly sure I would running the Goofy in 2014 as I felt I could have done better. Now Disney has announced the Dopey Challenge; 5K, 10K, Half Marathon and Marathon for a whopping 48.6 miles for 6 medals. I think I now have a new challenge.

My room is booked.
