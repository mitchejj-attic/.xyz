The week was cold, the week was also a week of forgetting and loosing items.

The cold, well check out the Dark Sky time machine data [Jan 4th][jan4], [Jan 5th][jan5], [Jan 6th][jan6], [Jan 7th][jan7].

What did I loose? I lost my one good working AirPod on Flight of passage. I also lost, or misplaced, my MagicBand when packing my luggage the night before my flight home. I eventually  did find the MagicBand a few days later shoved in the toe of my running shoes. As for the AirPods they where apparently still under warranty and was able to buy a new one (again) and have the lesser working one replaced for free.

What did I forget? I left my laptop charger at home, I forgot to eat breakfast before the half marathon, and forgot to bring my phone with me to the full marathon.


The Expo
I knew going into the weekend it was going to be cold. I also knew Wednesday was going to be a very wet day. Just before leaving I decided to bring my raincoat like outer shell with me. Flying into MCO was a bit bumpy after crossing into Florida. The landing was very rough, a fellow passenger behind was throwing up the last 10 minutes of the flight and the guy next to me was praying heavily. With the worries weather and air travel of past Marathon Weekends I wanted an early flight out just incase. Of course my room wouldn’t be ready so my plan was to take MagicExpress, hop off at the first resort stop then take the bus over to the WWOS of the Expo. Of course this would be the trip where POFQ would the first stop. I nonetheless stuck the plan. 

For me bib pick up was fairly easy, just waited outside in the rain for about 10-15 minutes before heading to bib pick-up station. No one was in front of me at the station and my name was on the very first page of the book; quick and easy.

I still had plenty of time before my room would be ready so I took a walk around the main expo floor, a very short walk. It all seemed like the typical runDisney vendors and I just wasn’t up for the typical expo fair. I did however wanted to check out the official runDisney merch store. That wait was just a mess, we waited good hour before being let, thankfully I was able to get a spot in line under a covered area. I did pick up a little something for myself as a token memory.

Now for the races; I actually felt really good all weekend long. I never really felt down and out. Sure I had some struggles, but over all I feel as if everything went better than I could have hoped for. My 5k and 10k times where okay and really never felt as if I was pushing myself and when I did feel like I might try to push I stopped for a short walk break to recollect my thoughts and let that adrenalin dilute itself. My half pace was a bit faster than my desired pace and felt as if it might have potential harm the following race. However, I didn't do anything stupid for the full. I did my best to ensure I used 30 second walk breaks early on and found a nice rhythm and pace.

Going into the weekend my 'A' goal for the marathon was to finish in 4:45-4:50; while my ideal happy race goal pace would have been around 11:30/mile to 11:55/mile. Some place around mile 18/19 is where my left foot started to act up, I backed the rhythm I started to settle into and started to walk more.  When my foot did feel better and tried to run I found it difficult to get my legs to turn over. The stadium is around the 20 mile mark I kept reminding myself its two 5k's away and 5k's are easy just push thru it.  I tried but eventually the pain in my foot started to cause my toes to feel numb; I running for fun, to push myself, I’m running to keep myself active I don’t need to push myself so far I injury myself so I can’t stay active and have fun.  I did finish, mostly walk but I did run some.

The weekend was an enjoyable escaped even if the weather wasn’t as nice as I had hoped for. I love doing the challenges but it does take away park time and leaves me feeling as if I’m missing out one something. I did enjoy seeing the tiger cubs, sleeping. I enjoyed the new route into the Magic Kingdom and I espically enjoyed seeing/watching a construction truck get stuck in the sandie construction behind the Magic Kingdom durning the half marathon. Must of all enjoyed finally getting a pair of my very own ears.
