The month started full of anticipation and optimism; vacation was right around the corner. As the month progressed the optimism mood slowly turn to melancholy then grim. The low lights of the month included my TV dying, bed riden with back pain for part of my vacation and more agonizing the death of a long friendship. As a result I haven't given this site much attention.
