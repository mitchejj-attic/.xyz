Introducing nullog.net

While I do like the Standard Error moniker I can't say for sure what prompted the change. I found the stderr.me name abit convoluted and silly. When the site came to be I also felt the premiss was a bit flawed. But did that unease drive the change? Undoubtedly that did factor into my desire change, yet it wasn't the only factor.
