For the last month and a half now I've been straying away from twitter. I don't have any good reason, when I really started to use twitter it replaced my use of RSS feeds. Now, as my use of twitter is dwindling my RSS use is picking back up again. Early in the year Google axed Reader, which is the client of choice by many. I used it back in the day... and I've now found a new replacement... I have a few concerns like the ability of it web client to scale (the ability to quickly refresh feeds). Will this be a long term change, replacement or a fad?
