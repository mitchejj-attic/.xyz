I've enjoyed rolling my own Rack server on Heroku. Yet, it always seemed to be a functional hack. Then I finally posed a seemly simple question. Why am I deploying to Heroku, what are the benefits? The reason I initial reason I was deplying to heroku for Jekyll plug-ins, beeing different, and the learning process. The only tangitable benefits hosting with Heroku offers me... crickets...wait I have the ability to control site routing via ModRewrite.

I believe Surge CDN [will offer a service which values][surgeMed] the 'things' I care about. Namely reliability, speed, and low latency. If I'm wrong I can always move back to Heroku.
