I've been putting of creating a plug-in that would take my images from flickr and embed them on pages here... was able to make a local working plug in fairly quicky. However, everytime I tried to push the site to heroku everything would fail with an error, `Liquid Exception: No API key or secret defined!`

Well the [solution was simple][simpleFix] and I kept glossing over it

	heroku labs:enable user-env-compile

Yes, thats right. With out that simple line I wasted 5+ hours.
