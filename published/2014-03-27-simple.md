Online shopping isn't anything new to me, after all I was one of the first people to buy and HD TV online way back when... then when had my last eye check up and prescription I went to [Warby Parker][wb]. The experience was rather quick and simple. Now when I'm looking to buy a new bed I'm following suit. However, I never thought about buying the little daily things online. I started looking into changing that by buying my shaving needs online from [Harrys][shave].

For some reason I felt the need to do a little research before making this particular purchase. I really don't know why but I did... and who would have guested a site dedicated to "personal grooming intelligence for consumers by consumers" called [razorpedia][razorpedia] exist. Sometimes the simple things lead to the odd ball finds.

What did I think of my shaving set from Harry's? First, I've only used the Mach line in the past; the Harry's blades seem nice, albeit a bit narrower than I would have expected. I wouldn't say they are any better or worse than what a person would find in the Mach lineup. I elected for the Truman handle, as I don't need a luxury handle. I did feel the handle asperity lacking a little something to grip on to when your hands are wet and slippery. I also haven't been able to figure out how to remove the blade heads... and finally the shaving cream. I'm not a fan, but I'm not a fan of shaving creams in general and prefer gels. I will have to give the cream a few more trials before I render my final judgment.
