Once again I'm taking inspiration from Jonas Forsberg and [Deploy to Heroku from Github](http://jonasforsberg.se/2012/07/29/deploy-to-heroku-from-github). However, I just couln't get the thing to work. So I backtracked to the orginal project [github-heroku-pusher](https://github.com/ajlai/github-heroku-pusher) and everything now seems to be in working order. I think I will circle back around to his method eventually, but for now, while I build out the site I'm going to follow the don't fix what isn't broken mantra.

So for now no more 'git push heroku master'... unless I'm fiddling with some config settings and something breaks...
