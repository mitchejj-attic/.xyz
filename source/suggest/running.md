* #### Clothing
  * I suppose one could say I am a bit cheap in this field. I find it hard to justify spending that much on my running clothing. What makes a $60 Nike shirt better than a similar shirt half the price? I personally prefer to spend the savings on shoes, gear, and well races (and the travel expences).
* #### Shoes
  * GoRun
    * Right now these are my go to shoes
* #### Gear
  * Magellan Echo
* #### Websites
