Let's be honest, the month started full of anticipation and optimism; vacation was right around the corner. As the month progressed the optimism mood slowly turn to melancholy before turning grim. As a result I haven't given this site much attention... the low lights of the month included my TV dying, bed riden with back pain for part of my vacation and more agonizing the death of a long last friendship. While the highlights came from two shopping trips buying a new running shoes (Schers Go Run 3 and Go Run Ride 3) then Harry's Shaving Gel... yes a very loop sided month to be sure.
