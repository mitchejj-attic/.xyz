I've enjoyed rolling my own Rack server on Heroku. Something never did feel right about it, and I could never put my finger on it. I think I've finally been about to figure out what that something was; the why. Why was I deploying to Heroku, what where the benefits? Deploying to Heroku, for me and the site, really had no benefits.^1 The only advantage of deploying to Heroku the learning process. Ultimately that 'advantage' has a relative short shelf life.

Now is the time; the time to move. Surge is still growing into what it will be but I believe it move in the right direction for 'things' I care about. Namely reliable uptime, speedy delivery, with low latency.

[^1]: **Update:** An advantage I forgot about was being able to some routing via rewrite rules.
