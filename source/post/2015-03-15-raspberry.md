I've been enjoying my new toy over my vacations thus far,  a vacation[winter, 2015] posting is in the works. What is this toy? This toy will essentially ensure my old MacBooks will get the boot as I have purchased a Raspberry Pi 2, running Arch Linux ARM. I really don't know what I'm going to do with the Pi yet... a fileserver or media center are the top contenders.
