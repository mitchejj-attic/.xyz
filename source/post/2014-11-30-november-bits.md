[^goRUN]: I don't think I've hidden the fact I've turned into a huge fan of the Skechers GOrun lineup. While I haven't seen nor tried the GOrun 4's I must admit I am skeptical at what I've initially seen trickle out prior to the NYC Marathon. However, I enjoy digesting the reviews as I slowly find them... and with each review I find myself looking forward to the trying them out myself.
