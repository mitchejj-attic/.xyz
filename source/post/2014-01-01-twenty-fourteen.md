I feel as if I should start the year off with a posting, but I have no New Years resolutions nor do I have any lofty goals. So I am stuck what shall I write.

The first challenge of the year will be the Doopy Challenge and I hope I find time to register for a few more events over the year. I hope to do a local event or two and I might consider doing RnR Chi again. Before I can consider those I must find time to head back to the gym and do the work the get stronger in both my legs and core.

When it comes to the site, I feel the changes I made over the last month and a half was just a stepping stone. All of the changes will help in moving the site to something a bit more modular and flexible. I just need to keep to the baby steps method, and use git properly, I have a vision in mind now I just need a plan and the drive to execute it.
